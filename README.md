# Enterprise Zero Trust Network
Self-directed cybersecurity apprenticeship: Zero Trust, networking, identity, VPN, logging, attacks, and defense.

This repository documents my self-directed cybersecurity apprenticeship where I am building an enterprise-style Zero Trust environment from the ground up.

## Phase 1 — Foundations (Completed)
In Phase 1 I learned and practiced:

- Linux network visibility (interfaces, routing, packet capture)
- Subnetting and segmentation concepts
- Firewall trust boundaries and attack surface awareness
- Identity fundamentals using RADIUS (basis of 802.1X / NAC)
- VPN and encrypted tunnel fundamentals
- System logging and SOC/SIEM visibility

## Next Phases
- Phase 2: Build the segmented enterprise lab (enforcement + architecture)
- Phase 3: Attack the environment (simulate real threats)
- Phase 4: Defend, detect, and document (SOC detections + reporting)
